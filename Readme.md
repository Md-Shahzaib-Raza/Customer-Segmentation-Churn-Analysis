## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

### 1. Customer Demographics
First, I analyzed the basic demographic makeup of the customer base.

**Key Insights:**
* **Gender Balance:** The customer base is split almost equally between male and female.
* **Senior Citizens:** Seniors represent a small minority of the total customer base, indicating that the service is primarily used by younger or middle-aged demographics.

### 2. Household Composition & Segmentation
I investigated the relationship between having a partner and having dependents to better understand household "stickiness."

**Key Insights:**
* **The "Independent" Segment:** The largest single group consists of customers with no partner and no dependents. Historically, these "single" households are often higher churn risks.
* **Childless Couples:** Among customers with a partner, nearly 50% do not have dependents.
* **Single Parents:** This is the smallest segment in the dataset, showing that customers without partners rarely have dependents in this particular telco base.
